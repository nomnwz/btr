        <div>
            <p>BTR was conceived in the Middle East by a small group of elite intelligence and military operatives who wanted to create experiences for individuals who had already achieved extraordinary success in their professional lives, but wanted to continue to challenge themselves with the kinds of covert intelligence and para-military style missions that you would find on the battlefields, streets, and back alleys of averse nations; all while simulating the secret and murky world of global clandestine operations.</p>
            <p>This small cadre has transformed their global network, covert experiences, and specialized training into a one-of-a-kind company that now provides exclusive clientele with experiences that cannot be found anywhere else.</p>
